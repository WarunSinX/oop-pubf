In beta phase, the PUBF game have more types of player that contain PremiumPlayer , Sniper , Warrior , Wanderer , StrongWanderer
So, We use subtype polymorphism to reduce the things that have to write in each class that add more in beta phase.
In each class we extends from Player class that super class for Other class that create new , except StrongWanderer class that extend from Wanderer class.

Player class will be super-class of others class such as PremiumPlayer, Sniper, Warrior, Wanderer

Wanderer class will be super-class of StrongWanderer

Player -> Wanderer -> StrongWanderer

TestSniper.java ;

Line 12; Player[] players = {new Player(5,4,"Normal"), new Sniper(5, 6, "Sniper")};
	That is Subtype polymorphism.

- Subtype Polymorphism: In Arguments and Arrays.
	+ Player[] players that is array type.
	+ Player[] players that Sniper -> Player 
	+ Sniper class -> Player class so it is a upcasting.


TestWarrior.java ;

Line 13;  Player[] players = {new Player(5,4,"Normal"), new Warrior(5, 5, "War")};
	That is Subtype polymorphism.

- Subtype Polymorphism: In Arguments and Arrays.
	+ Player[] players that is array type.
	+ Player[] players that Warrior -> Player 
	+ Warrior class -> Player Class so it is a upcasting.



TestStrongWanderer.java ;
	
	Line 12; StrongWanderer sw = new StrongWanderer(5, 5, "SWan");
	Line 13; Player p = new Player(5,7,"Normal");
	Line 14; Warrior w = new Warrior(5,6,"War");
	Line 15; Player[] players = {p, sw, w};

- Subtype Polymorphism: In Arguments and Arrays.
	+ Player[] players that is array type.
	+ StrongWanderer class -> Wanderrer class -> Player class
	So, StrongWanderer is subclass of Wanderer class and Wanderer class is subclass of Player class. It is a upcasting.
	


TestWanderer.java ;
	
	Line 12; Player[] players = {new Wanderer(5, 5, "Wan")};
- Subtype Polymorphism: In Arguments and Arrays.
	+ player[] players that is array type.
	+ Wanderer class -> Player class. So it is a upcasting.
